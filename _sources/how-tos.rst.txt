These are a few examples of use of the Gdstk library that go beyond basic geometry building.
They should serve as reference for more complex tasks.

Parametric Cell
***************

A parametric cell is a concept present in a few layout editors to facilitate the creation of geometries based on user-defined parameters.
Gdstk does not have a parameterized cell class, but since we are building the layout from a programming language, the full flexibility of the language can be used.

In this example we define a function that returns a grating coupler based on user-defined parameters.

.. literalinclude:: pcell.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: grating

This function can be used in the following manner:

.. literalinclude:: pcell.py
   :language: python
   :start-at: if __name__
   :end-at: write_gds

Parts Library
*************

Creating a Library
==================

A GDSII parts library can be used when there are several devices that are often used in different layouts.
It can be a personal library of devices, or part of a process design kit (PDK) offered by the company responsible for fabrication.

Here we create a simple personal library with 3 components: an alignment mark, a directional coupler and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
All parts are added to a GDSII file and saved for later.
Note that the interferometer already uses the directional coupler as a subcomponent.

.. literalinclude:: photonics.py
   :language: python
   :start-at: import
   :end-at: write_gds


.. _using-a-library:

Using a Library
===============

The library "photonics.gds" created above is used in the design of a larger layout.
It is imported through :func:`gdstk.read_rawcells` so that is uses as little memory and processing power as possible.

.. important:: Using `gdstk.RawCell` will only work properly when both the library and the current layout use the same unit and precision.

Another option for creating libraries is to store them as python modules.
The grating example in :ref:`parametric-cell` can be saved in a file "photonics.py" and imported as a Python module, as long as it can be found in the Python path (leaving it in the current working directory is sufficient).

.. literalinclude:: layout.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: from tutorial_images
   :end-at: write_gds

.. image:: _static/how-tos/layout.*
   :align: center


***************
Transformations
***************

Geometry transformations can be accomplished in several ways.
Individual polygons or paths can be transformed by their respective methods (:meth:`gdstk.Polygon.scale`, :meth:`gdstk.FlexPath.rotate`, :meth:`gdstk.RobustPath.translate`, etc.).

In order to transform an entire :class:`gdstk.Cell`, we can use a :class:`gdstk.Reference` with the desired transformation or create a transformed copy with :meth:`gdstk.Cell.copy`.
The former has the advantage of using less memory, because it does not create actual copies of the geometry or labels, so it is generally preferable.
The latter is particularly useful when changes to the transformed cell contents are needed and the original should not be modified.

.. literalinclude:: transforms.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: from tutorial_images import draw
   :end-before: main.name

.. image:: _static/how-tos/transforms.*
   :align: center

.. note::
   The SVG output does not support the `scale_width` attribute of paths, that is why the width of the path in the referencer-scaled version of the geometry is wider that the original.
   When using :meth:`gdstk.Cell.copy`, the attribute is respected.
   This is also a problem for some GDSII viewers and editors.

******************
Geometry Filtering
******************

Filtering the geometry of a loaded library requires only iterating over the desired cells and objects, testing and removing those not wanted.
In this example we load the layout created in :ref:`using-a-library` and remove the polygons in layer 2 (grating teeth) and paths in layer 10 (in the MZI).

.. literalinclude:: filtering.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: from tutorial_images import draw
   :end-at: write_gds

.. image:: _static/how-tos/filtering.*
   :align: center

Another common use of filtering is to remove geometry in a particular region.
In this example we create a periodic background and remove all elements that overlap a particular shape using :func:`gdstk.inside` to test.

.. literalinclude:: pos_filtering.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: from tutorial_images import draw
   :end-at: write_gds

.. image:: _static/how-tos/pos_filtering.*
   :align: center


*******************
Points Along a Path
*******************

The following example shows how to add markers along a :class:`gdstk.RobustPath`.
It uses the original parameterization of the path to locate the markers, following the construction sections.
Markers positioned at a fixed distance must be calculated for each section independently.

.. literalinclude:: path_markers.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: from tutorial_images import draw
   :end-before: main.name

.. image:: _static/how-tos/path_markers.*
   :align: center

************
System Fonts
************

This example uses `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ to render text using any typeface present in the system.
The glyph paths are then transformed into polygon arrays that can be used to create :class:`gdstk.Polygon` objects.

.. literalinclude:: fonts.py
   :language: python
   :start-at: import gdstk
   :end-at: cell.add

.. image:: _static/how-tos/fonts.*
   :align: center
